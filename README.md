# Personal Dashboard Chrome Extension
 Chrome extension that displays a personal dashboard whenever a new tab is opened. Includes current data for the time, weather, current crypto information, and more. 
 Practice for using Fetch requests and async JS. 
 
 Everytime a new tab is opened, the background image will change! (and all other data will update as well of course)
